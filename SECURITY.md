## 📊 Security Monitoring

We monitor for:
- Failed login attempts (>3 in 15 minutes)

- Unauthorized API access
- Suspicious activity patterns

Critical security events trigger immediate alerts.

## 🔐 Password Requirements

- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character

## 🌐 Supported Security Standards

- **OWASP Top 10 (2021)** compliance
- **PCI DSS** requirements (via payment providers)
- **GDPR** ready (data export, deletion, consent)
- **DPDP Act 2023** (India) compliance planned

## 📝 Security Audit Log

All security-relevant events are logged:
- Authentication attempts (success/failure)
- OTP requests and verifications
- Password changes
- Payment transactions
- Data exports
- Account deletions

Logs are retained for 90 days and are encrypted at rest.

## 🚀 Deployment Security

### Environment Variables
- All secrets stored in Vercel Environment Variables
- Separate keys for development/production
- Secrets rotated quarterly
- No secrets in source code (enforced by pre-commit hooks)

### Infrastructure
- Hosted on Vercel (SOC 2 Type II certified)

## 🛡️ Day 5 Security Audit & Fixes (Oct 17, 2025)

**Status:** 🟢 Production-Ready Security Posture

### Critical Security Fixes (PR #25)

**1. Input Validation Comprehensive Coverage**
- ✅ Created `lib/validators.ts` with Zod schemas
- ✅ Applied validation to ALL server actions:
  - Subscription operations (create, update, delete)
  - Usage tracking (OAuth + manual)
  - Recommendations (generate, accept, dismiss)
  - Bundle operations
- ✅ UUID validation prevents injection attacks
- ✅ Number validation prevents overflow/underflow
- ✅ String length limits prevent DoS
- ✅ Enum validation ensures data integrity

**2. OAuth Token Encryption (AES-256-GCM)**
- ✅ Created `lib/crypto/encryption.ts`
- ✅ All OAuth tokens encrypted before database storage
- ✅ Authenticated encryption (GCM mode)
- ✅ Graceful fallback if ENCRYPTION_KEY not configured
- ✅ Backward compatible with existing plaintext tokens
- ✅ Console warnings for insecure configurations
- ✅ Users can migrate by reconnecting services

**3. CSRF Protection**
- ✅ State token generation for OAuth flows
- ✅ httpOnly cookie storage for state tokens
- ✅ Token validation in OAuth callbacks
- ✅ Prevents cross-site request forgery attacks
- ✅ Protects sensitive operations (Spotify OAuth, etc.)

**4. Rate Limiting**
- ✅ IP-based rate limiting on API routes
- ✅ Prevents API abuse and DoS attacks
- ✅ Configurable limits per endpoint
- ✅ In-memory implementation (suitable for single-instance)
- ✅ Future: Redis-based for multi-instance deployments

**5. Race Condition Prevention**
- ✅ Created `lib/utils/debounce.ts`
- ✅ Fire-and-forget pattern with debouncing

- ✅ Used in recommendation generation

**6. Memory Leak Fixes**
- ✅ Fixed useAuth infinite re-render
- ✅ Supabase client caching (prevents unbounded WebSocket connections)

- ✅ Before: 100 calls = 100 connections (memory leak)
- ✅ After: 100 calls = 1 connection (stable)

**7. Comprehensive Security Documentation**
- ✅ Completed security audit (23 issues audited)
- ✅ Categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- ✅ All critical (5) and high-priority (2) issues resolved
- ✅ Production readiness checklist completed
