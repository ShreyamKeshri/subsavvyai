## âœ… Recently Fixed (Day 2 - Oct 12, 2025)

### 1. âœ… FIXED: RESEND_API_KEY Blocking Signup Flow
**Fixed in:** `lib/email/email-service.ts`

**Problem:**
- Module-level initialization threw error if RESEND_API_KEY not set
- Blocked entire signup flow even though email is optional

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed to lazy initialization with `getResendClient()` function
- Graceful fallback if API key not configured
- Signup flow no longer blocked

---

### 2. âœ… FIXED: Settings Page Database Errors
**Fixed in:** `lib/settings/settings-actions.ts`

**Problem:**
- "column profiles.user_id does not exist" error
- Incorrect column reference: `user_id` should be `id`
- Currency column name mismatch

**Solution Applied:**
- Changed `.eq('user_id', user.id)` â†’ `.eq('id', user.id)`
- Fixed currency column reference
- Settings page now loads and updates correctly

---

### 3. âœ… FIXED: Edit/Delete Subscription Placeholders
**Fixed in:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Solution Applied:**

**Fixed in:** `app/layout.tsx`, `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx`

**Problem:**

- Flash of wrong theme on page load

**Solution Applied:**

### 5. âœ… FIXED: Spotify OAuth Documentation Missing
**Fixed in:** Created `SPOTIFY_SETUP.md`

**Problem:**

**Solution Applied:**
- Comprehensive setup guide with step-by-step instructions
- Fixed redirect URI to use 127.0.0.1 (Spotify requirement)

## Priority: Medium

### 1. Onboarding Flow Needs Refinement
**Status:** Deferred (not blocking MVP)

**Issue:**
- User's name already captured during signup
- Onboarding asks for name again
- Redundant step

**Proposed Solution:**
- Skip name collection in onboarding if already have it
- Focus onboarding on preferences:
  - Budget setting
  - Category interests
  - Notification preferences
  - Quick tour of features

---

### 2. Theme Preference Not Synced to Database
**Status:** Low priority (localStorage works)

**Issue:**
- Theme stored in localStorage only
- Not synced to `user_preferences` table
- Won't sync across devices

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add `theme` column to `user_preferences` table
- Update theme on change via server action
- Load theme from database on login
- Fall back to localStorage if not logged in

---

### 3. Email Templates Need Branding Update
**Status:** Tracked in EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md

**Issue:**
- Welcome email uses basic template
- Needs SubSavvyAI branding improvements
- Could use better formatting

**Proposed Solution:**
- Update email templates with new design
- Add logo and brand colors
- Improve mobile responsiveness
- See EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md for details

---

## Priority: Low

### 1. SMS Provider Not Configured
**Status:** Feature deferred to Month 2

**Issue:**
- Phone OTP authentication not set up
- No SMS provider configured (Twilio, MessageBird, etc.)

**Note:**
- Email and Google OAuth sufficient for MVP
- Will implement in Month 2 if needed

---

### 2. Migration 007 Not Yet Applied
**Status:** Pending Supabase execution

**Issue:**
- Migration 007 (manual usage tracking) created but not run in Supabase
- Usage survey dialog exists but can't save data until migration runs

**Action Required:**
1. Run migration 007 in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Reload PostgREST schema: `NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';`
3. Test manual usage tracking end-to-end
