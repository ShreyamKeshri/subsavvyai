## ‚úÖ Critical Security Fixes (Day 5 - Oct 17, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: useAuth Infinite Re-render Bug
**Fixed in:** PR #25, Commit `4eaa0b5`
**File:** `hooks/useAuth.ts`

**Problem:**
- Supabase client created outside useEffect on every render
- Dependencies `[router, supabase]` caused infinite re-render loop
- Led to memory leaks and browser freezing
- Critical performance impact on all authenticated pages

**Solution Applied:**
- Moved Supabase client creation inside useEffect
- Changed dependency array from `[router, supabase]` to `[]` (run once on mount)
- Properly unsubscribe from auth state changes on unmount

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: Missing Input Validation (CRITICAL)
**Fixed in:** PR #25, Commit `ed97fc5`
**Files:** `lib/subscriptions/subscription-actions.ts`, `lib/usage/manual-usage-actions.ts`, `lib/recommendations/recommendation-actions.ts`

**Problem:**
- All user inputs passed directly to database without validation
- Risk of SQL injection, XSS, and data corruption
- Zod schemas existed but were never used

**Solution Applied:**
- Applied Zod validation to all subscription CRUD operations

### 3. ‚úÖ FIXED: Missing CSRF State Verification (CRITICAL)
**Fixed in:** PR #25, Commit `a2f2277`
**Files:** `app/api/oauth/spotify/connect/route.ts`, `app/api/oauth/spotify/callback/route.ts`

**Problem:**
- Spotify OAuth generated state token but never verified it
- Exposed to CSRF attacks where attackers could link their Spotify to victim's account

**Solution Applied:**
- Generate 32-byte random state token in connect route
- Store state and user ID in httpOnly cookies (10-minute expiry)
- Verify state matches in callback route (constant-time comparison)
- Verify user ID matches to prevent session hijacking
- Clear OAuth cookies after successful verification

---

### 4. ‚úÖ FIXED: Missing Rate Limiting (CRITICAL)
**Fixed in:** PR #25, Commit `35fb17e`
**Files:** All API routes

**Problem:**
- Rate limit utilities existed but were never used
- All API routes vulnerable to abuse and brute force attacks
- OAuth routes had no throttling

**Solution Applied:**
- OAuth routes: 10 attempts per 15 minutes per IP
- Usage sync API: 30 requests per minute per IP
- Recommendations API: 30 requests per minute per IP
- Returns 429 status with resetAt timestamp

**Fixed in:** PR #25, Commit `4c8ebd6`
**Files:** `lib/utils/debounce.ts` (NEW), `lib/subscriptions/subscription-actions.ts`, `lib/usage/manual-usage-actions.ts`

**Problem:**
- Multiple concurrent calls to generateRecommendations() and generateBundleRecommendations()
- When user adds/updates/deletes multiple subscriptions rapidly, race conditions occurred
- Multiple concurrent database writes could corrupt recommendations

**Solution Applied:**
- Created debounce utility with per-key timer management
- Debounced AI and bundle recommendation generation (2-second delay)
- Applied to subscription and usage operations
- Shared debounce keys across files for global deduplication

## üêõ Active Issues (Day 3 - Oct 13, 2025)

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: Spotify OAuth `service_not_found` Error
**Status:** Fixed (Day 5 - Oct 17, 2025)
**File:** `app/api/oauth/spotify/callback/route.ts`
**Fix:** `supabase/seeds/001_indian_services.sql`

**Problem:**
- After successful Spotify OAuth, redirects to dashboard with error: `oauth_error=service_not_found`
- Callback route can't find "Spotify" service in database
- OAuth flow completes but fails at final step
- **Root Cause:** Services table was empty - seed data needs to be run separately from migrations

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Click "Connect Spotify" on dashboard
2. Authorize app on Spotify
3. Get redirected back to dashboard
4. URL shows: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?oauth_error=service_not_found`

**Solution Applied:**
- Seed data exists in `supabase/seeds/001_indian_services.sql` with 52 popular Indian services
- Includes Spotify, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and 49+ other services
- Seed file was run in Supabase to populate services table
- Spotify OAuth now works correctly
