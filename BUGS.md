## üêõ Active Issues (Day 3 - Oct 13, 2025)

### 1. üî¥ HIGH: Spotify OAuth `service_not_found` Error
**Status:** In Progress (Day 3)
**File:** `app/api/oauth/spotify/callback/route.ts`

**Problem:**
- After successful Spotify OAuth, redirects to dashboard with error: `oauth_error=service_not_found`
- Callback route can't find "Spotify" service in database
- OAuth flow completes but fails at final step

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Click "Connect Spotify" on dashboard
2. Authorize app on Spotify
3. Get redirected back to dashboard
4. URL shows: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard?oauth_error=service_not_found`

**Proposed Solution:**
- Check how service lookup is done in callback route
- Verify "Spotify" exists in `services` table with correct name/slug
- May need to seed Spotify service if missing
- Check case sensitivity in service name matching

**Priority:** HIGH (blocks Spotify OAuth feature)

### 2. üî¥ HIGH: Google OAuth Login Not Working
**Status:** Should be fixed (needs testing)
**Files:** `lib/auth/auth-helpers.ts`, `.env.local`

**Problem:**
- Google OAuth was broken after changing `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` to 127.0.0.1
- Google Cloud Console expects `localhost` redirect URI

**Solution Applied (Day 3):**
- Created separate `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` env variable
- Reverted `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` back to `localhost`
- Google OAuth should now work again

**Next Action:** Test Google login after restarting dev server

---

### 3. üü° MEDIUM: Signup Page Issues
**Status:** Not yet investigated
**File:** `app/(auth)/signup/page.tsx`

**Problem:**

- Specific issue not yet identified

**Next Action:** Investigate signup flow and identify issues

---

### 4. üü° MEDIUM: Type Errors
**Status:** Not yet checked
**Command:** `npm run type-check`

**Problem:**

**Next Action:** Run `npm run type-check` and fix any TypeScript errors

---

### 5. üü¢ LOW: Dashboard Spotify Button Route Fixed
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED (Day 3)
**File:** `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
- Button called non-existent route `/api/oauth/spotify`
- Should call `/api/oauth/spotify/connect`

**Solution Applied:**
- Updated button onClick to use correct route
- Committed in PR #16

---

## Priority: Medium

### 1. Onboarding Flow Needs Refinement
**Status:** Deferred (not blocking MVP)

**Issue:**
- User's name already captured during signup
- Onboarding asks for name again
- Redundant step

**Proposed Solution:**
- Skip name collection in onboarding if already have it
- Focus onboarding on preferences:
  - Budget setting
  - Category interests
  - Notification preferences
  - Quick tour of features

---

### 2. Theme Preference Not Synced to Database
**Status:** Low priority (localStorage works)

**Issue:**
- Theme stored in localStorage only
- Not synced to `user_preferences` table
- Won't sync across devices

**Proposed Solution:**
- Add `theme` column to `user_preferences` table
- Update theme on change via server action
- Load theme from database on login
- Fall back to localStorage if not logged in

---

### 3. Email Templates Need Branding Update
**Status:** Tracked in EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md

**Issue:**

---

## Priority: Low

### 1. SMS Provider Not Configured
**Status:** Feature deferred to Month 2

**Status:** Pending Supabase execution

**Issue:**
- Migration 007 (manual usage tracking) created but not run in Supabase
- Usage survey dialog exists but can't save data until migration runs

**Action Required:**
1. Run migration 007 in Supabase SQL Editor
