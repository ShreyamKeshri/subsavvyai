## 9. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk 1: Production Bugs on Launch Day**
- **Mitigation:** Thorough testing + beta period
- **Contingency:** Hotfix process ready, rollback plan

**Risk 2: Server Overload (Unlikely for MVP)**
- **Mitigation:** Vercel auto-scaling, Supabase handles scale
- **Contingency:** Upgrade plan if needed

**Risk 3: Email Deliverability Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Test across providers, verify domain
- **Contingency:** Use SendGrid as backup

### Product Risks

**Risk 4: Low Activation Rate**
- **Mitigation:** Simplified onboarding, clear CTAs
- **Contingency:** A/B test onboarding variations

**Risk 5: Users Don't Connect Spotify**
- **Mitigation:** Clear value prop, easy flow
- **Contingency:** Add more services (Netflix API is limited)

**Risk 6: Bundle Recommendations Don't Match Well**
- **Mitigation:** Test with diverse subscription sets
- **Contingency:** Improve matching algorithm post-launch

### Market Risks

**Risk 7: Low Interest/Signups**
- **Mitigation:** Strong launch on multiple channels
- **Contingency:** Paid ads (small budget), influencer outreach

**Risk 8: Competition Launches Similar Product**
- **Mitigation:** Speed to market (launch Oct 31)
- **Contingency:** Focus on India-specific advantage
