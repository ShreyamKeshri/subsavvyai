   - Fixed redirect URI to use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost (Spotify requirement)
   - OAuth implementation complete (connect route + callback route)
   - ✅ IMPLEMENTED: Manual usage tracking for Netflix, Hotstar, Prime Video, YouTube Premium, etc.
     - Migration 007: Added manual usage fields to service_usage table
     - Server actions for CRUD operations on manual usage data
     - Usage survey dialog component with frequency selection
     - Converts frequency to estimated hours for AI recommendations
