**Spotify OAuth Fixes (PR #16):**

- [x] Fixed dashboard button route: `/api/oauth/spotify` → `/api/oauth/spotify/connect` ✅
- [x] Created separate `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` env variable ✅
  - Spotify uses `http://127.0.0.1:3000/api/oauth/spotify/callback` (required by Spotify API)
  - App URL uses `http://localhost:3000` (for Google OAuth, email links, etc.)
- [x] Updated `.env.example` with clear documentation ✅

**Known Issues (Need to Fix):**

1. **Sign Up page** - needs to be fixed
2. **Google OAuth login** - Should work now after reverting to localhost (needs testing)
3. **Type errors** - Run `npm run type-check` to identify
4. **Spotify OAuth error** - `oauth_error=service_not_found` after Spotify connection
   - Issue: Callback route can't find Spotify service in database
   - Need to investigate: app/api/oauth/spotify/callback/route.ts
5. **Dev Server** - Needs restart to load new `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` env variable

**Next Actions:**
- Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
- Test Google OAuth login (should work now)
- Fix Spotify `service_not_found` error in callback route
- Address type errors
- Fix signup page issues
