- **Build for mobile first** - Most Indians access web on phones
- **Price for India** - ‚Çπ199-‚Çπ499/month, not $29/month
- **UPI is king** - Make sure UPI works flawlessly
- **Community matters** - SaaSBoomi, Reddit India, YourStory
- **Patience** - Indian market takes time but is worth it ($30B by 2025)
