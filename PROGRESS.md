## 📋 Technical Debt / Known Issues

### From BUGS.md:
1. ⏳ Onboarding flow needs refinement (name already captured)
2. ⏳ Theme preference not saved to database (will fix in Settings)
3. ⏳ Email templates need branding
4. ⏳ SMS provider not configured (phone auth pending)

### Performance:
- Dashboard loads all subscriptions at once (needs pagination for 100+)
- Analytics cache refresh can be slow (already optimized with SECURITY DEFINER)
