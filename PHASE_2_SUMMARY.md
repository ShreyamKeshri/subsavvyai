## 🏗️ Database Architecture Highlights

### Security Features
✅ **Row-Level Security (RLS)** enabled on all tables
✅ **User data isolation** - users can only access their own data
✅ **Public read access** for `services` and `cancellation_guides`
✅ **Service role protection** for admin operations
✅ **Audit trails** with `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps
✅ **Soft deletes** for subscriptions (preserves history)

### Performance Optimizations
✅ **25+ indexes** for common query patterns
✅ **Partial indexes** for filtered queries (active subscriptions only)
✅ **Composite indexes** for multi-column queries (user_id + status)
✅ **GIN indexes** for full-text search (service names)
✅ **Materialized view** for analytics (popular services)
✅ **Analytics caching** with auto-refresh triggers
✅ **Query optimization** with proper index strategies

### Data Integrity
✅ **Foreign key constraints** for referential integrity
✅ **Check constraints** for data validation (cost >= 0, valid currency codes)
✅ **Enum types** for status fields (prevents invalid values)
✅ **Unique constraints** (one default payment method per user)
✅ **Auto-triggers** for timestamps and cancellation dates
✅ **Protected audit columns** (can't manually modify created_at)

### Scalability Features
✅ **Normalized 3NF design** minimizes redundancy
✅ **JSONB columns** for flexible semi-structured data
✅ **Partitioning ready** (for payment_history when > 10M rows)
✅ **Archiving strategy** (move old cancelled subscriptions)
✅ **Read replica support** (route analytics to replica)
✅ **Connection pooling** (via Supabase PgBouncer)

### ⏳ Pending Tasks

1. **Execute Migration in Supabase** (5 minutes)
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run `001_initial_schema.sql`
   - Verify 9 tables created

2. **Seed Services Data** (2 minutes)
   - Run `001_indian_services.sql`
   - Verify 49 services inserted

3. **Generate TypeScript Types** (3 minutes)
   - Use Supabase CLI: `supabase gen types typescript`
   - Save to `types/database.ts`

4. **Test Database Connection** (5 minutes)

   - Verify data access from Next.js

5. **Update Progress Tracking** (2 minutes)
   - Mark Phase 2 checkpoints as complete

6. **Create Pull Request** (3 minutes)
   - Merge `feature/phase-2-database-design` to `main`

## 🚀 What's Next (Phase 3)

After completing Phase 2 manual steps, you'll be ready for:

**Phase 3: Authentication System**
- Setup Supabase Auth with phone OTP
- Build login/signup UI
- Implement protected routes
- Session management
- OAuth providers (Google, etc.)

With the database schema in place, Phase 3 will focus on user authentication and authorization.

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why Soft Deletes?
- Preserves historical data for analytics
- Allows "undelete" functionality
- Audit compliance requirements
- Uses `deleted_at` timestamp instead of hard DELETE

### Why Analytics Caching?
- Dashboard needs to be fast (<100ms)
- Calculating monthly spend on-the-fly is expensive
- Auto-refresh via trigger keeps cache fresh
- Falls back to real-time calculation if needed

### Why JSONB for Category Breakdown?
- Flexible schema (categories may change)
- Fast queries with GIN indexes
- No need for separate category_analytics table
- Easy to serialize for API responses

### Why Materialized View for Popular Services?
- Expensive join query (services + subscription counts)
- Only needs refresh daily (not real-time)
- Much faster than live aggregation
- Can be refreshed via cron job

### Why Separate notification_preferences Table?
- 1:1 relationship with users
- Could be in profiles, but keeps profiles lean
- Logical separation of concerns
- Easier to extend notification features

2. **Index foreign keys** - Improves join performance dramatically
3. **Use enums for status** - Prevents invalid data entry
4. **Soft deletes over hard deletes** - Preserves history
5. **Cache expensive queries** - Pre-calculate dashboard metrics
6. **Timestamp everything** - Audit trails are invaluable
7. **Document constraints** - Future developers will thank you
8. **Test migrations** - Verify on staging before production
